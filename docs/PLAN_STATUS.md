# Implementation Plan Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** Active - Using Unified Plan

---

## Active Plan

**PRIMARY**: [`/Users/les/Projects/session-mgmt-mcp/docs/UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`](../session-mgmt-mcp/docs/UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)

This unified 13-week plan consolidates:
- mcp-common 10-week implementation plan
- session-mgmt-mcp 16-week improvement plan
- Eliminates 80+ hours of duplicate work
- Provides clear critical path and dependencies

**Current Phase**: Week 3 - Test Infrastructure Crisis (BLOCKER)

---

## Historical Plans (Superseded 2025-10-28)

### 1. IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (10-week mcp-common plan)

**Status**: Superseded by UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

**What Was Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 1: ACB Foundation (mcp-common v2.0 adapters)
- ✅ Phase 2: Critical Fixes (session-mgmt, unifi, mailgun, excalidraw)
- ✅ Phase 3: Security Hardening (foundation complete, integration pending)

**What Remains** (Now in Unified Plan):
- Week 4-5: Coverage restoration (was Phase 4)
- Week 6: mcp-common v2.0 release (was Phase 5 start)
- Week 7-8: Ecosystem rollout (was Phase 5 completion)
- Week 9-13: Excellence sprint (was Phase 6-7)

**File Location**: `/Users/les/Projects/mcp-common/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Preservation**: Keep for historical reference and detailed technical specifications

## How to Track Progress

### Weekly Status (Primary)

Check **UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** for:
- Current week objectives
- Quality metrics dashboard
- Blocking issues
- Next week priorities

### Project-Specific Status

**session-mgmt-mcp:**
```bash
cd /Users/les/Projects/session-mgmt-mcp
cat docs/UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md | grep "Week [0-9]:"
```

**mcp-common:**
```bash
cd /Users/les/Projects/mcp-common
cat PLAN_STATUS.md  # This file
```

### Quality Dashboard (CI/CD)

Run quality checks:
```bash
# session-mgmt-mcp
cd /Users/les/Projects/session-mgmt-mcp
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
python -m mypy session_mgmt_mcp/
python -m ruff check .

# mcp-common
cd /Users/les/Projects/mcp-common
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
python -m mypy mcp_common/
python -m ruff check .
```

## Key Decisions from Unification

### What Changed

**1. Timeline: 26 weeks → 13 weeks (50% reduction)**

Original separate plans:
- mcp-common: 10 weeks
- session-mgmt: 16 weeks
- Total: 26 weeks (overlapping but unclear)

Unified plan:
- 13 weeks total (clear sequencing)
- Test crisis resolved in Week 3
- Production ready by Week 13

**2. Work Eliminated: 80+ hours saved**

Duplicate work removed:
- ACB config migration (already done via MCPBaseSettings)
- HTTP client implementation (use mcp-common HTTPClientAdapter)
- DI container custom code (use ACB depends directly)

YAGNI work deferred:
- Template system (string formatting works fine)
- Event system (async/await + FastMCP sufficient)
- Query interface (SQL/PGQ works directly)

**3. Critical Path Identified**

```
Week 3: Fix test infrastructure (BLOCKER)
  ↓
Week 4-5: Restore coverage to 60%
  ↓
Week 6: Release mcp-common v2.0
  ↓
Week 7-8: Ecosystem adoption (9 servers)
  ↓
Week 11-13: Excellence sprint (85%+ coverage, 95/100 quality)
```

**4. Scope Clarified**

IN SCOPE (13-week plan):
- ✅ Test infrastructure fixes
- ✅ Coverage restoration (60% → 85%)
- ✅ mcp-common v2.0 release
- ✅ Ecosystem adoption (9 servers)
- ✅ DuckPGQ knowledge graph completion
- ✅ Security integration testing
- ✅ Quality excellence (95/100)

OUT OF SCOPE (deferred):
- ❌ Templates, events, query interfaces (YAGNI)
- ❌ Advanced observability (Phase 2)
- ❌ Multi-tenancy (if needed later)

## Agent Review Consensus

The unified plan was reviewed by 6 specialized agents:

1. **Documentation Specialist**: "Excellent consolidation, clear structure"
2. **Architecture Council**: "Architecturally sound, dependencies clear"
3. **Delivery Lead**: "Realistic timeline, good risk management"
4. **Python Pro**: "Technical priorities correct, YAGNI enforcement proper"
5. **Code Reviewer**: "Quality gates appropriate, test focus critical"
6. **General-Purpose**: "Comprehensive analysis, actionable recommendations"

**Consensus**: Approved for execution with 85% confidence

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 3 Day 1)

1. **Review unified plan** with stakeholders
2. **Start test infrastructure fixes** (SessionLogger DI registration)
3. **Track progress** via weekly checkpoints

### This Week (Week 3)

1. Fix 14 test collection errors
2. Restore test execution (target: 80% passing)
3. Measure actual coverage baseline
4. Set coverage ratchet in CI

### Next Week (Week 4)

1. Coverage restoration to 50%
2. Core module testing (DuckPGQ, health checks, shutdown)
3. Integration test fixes
